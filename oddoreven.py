# Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers.
# The program will create two other text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. 
# The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.
    
# Open the text file containing the 20 integers and have the program read it.
# Then create two text files, one for even numbers, the other one for odd numbers.
# If the number is even, write to the even numbers text file
# If the number is odd, write to the odd numbers text file.
